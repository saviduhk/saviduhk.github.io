Welcome to my portfolio! I am a graduate 3D artist from the University of South Wales, specializing in hard surface modeling. I am currently seeking a Junior 3D role that allows me to utilize my expertise in this area while also continuing to expand my knowledge in procedural tool creation using Houdini.

With a strong foundation in industry-standard software such as Autodesk Maya and the Adobe Substance Suite, I possess the skills to create realistic and visually stunning 3D assets. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments and excel at overcoming complex challenges to deliver high-quality projects within deadlines.

Throughout my education and previous internships, I have gained valuable experience working on diverse projects, including character modeling, environment creation, and props modeling. I have an impeccable eye for detail and a commitment to exceeding expectations with my work. I am eager to learn from seasoned professionals and further develop my skill set.

If you are in search of a dedicated and adaptable 3D generalist who is passionate about growth and making a positive impact, I would love to get in touch with you!
